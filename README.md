# README for Wikipedia Book Recommendation System
Overview
This project is a data science initiative focused on analyzing Wikipedia data to build a book recommendation system. The project involves downloading and parsing Wikipedia data, exploring the data, and conducting exploratory analysis to derive valuable insights for generating personalized book recommendations.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:
Wikipedia Data Downloading and Parsing: This module is responsible for retrieving Wikipedia data and parsing it for analysis.
Data Exploration: This phase includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify patterns and trends.
Book Recommendation System: The core functionality that uses the parsed data and analytical insights to recommend books based on user preferences.
# Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
numpy
gensim
pandas
requests
beautifulsoup4
You can install the required packages using pip:
